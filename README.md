# 🚗 License Plate Detection with YOLO + Streamlit

This project demonstrates **real-time License Plate Detection** using a **YOLO model** and a simple **Streamlit web app**.  
It allows you to detect license plates from:
- 📷 **Live Camera (Webcam)**
- 🖼️ **Uploaded Images**
- 📌 **Save Screenshots** with detection results
